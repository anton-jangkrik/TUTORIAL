## Quick Setup

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
services:
  app:
    image: 'docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '81:81'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d

```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

[http://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.
